Anyway, but in addition
I was letting them in on this hack.
总之，但是另外我会让他们也加入//fixme

00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,500

users on that computer joined me

它是怎么开始的？谁开始的？

It actually began with the start
of computers because at that time

137
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,400
software was just passed around between people
因为在那时软件只是在人们之间相互传递

138
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:58,400
And I think it was only like in the
lates 70's or early 80's
我想那只是在70年代末和80年代初

00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,500
That people started really closing up
their software,

some of that on Microsoft,
...嗯，你可以因为这些后果而指责Microsoft

had been to freely pass around software

its ownership

books and software itself.

the hundreds of people who say they are
using BASIC has all been positive.
成千上万的说自己用BASIC的人中得到反馈证明了这一点。

Two surprising things are apparent, however.

worth less than 2 dollars an hour
使花在Altair BASIC的时间只值2美元一小时（ft，我现在也差不多）

in hobby software.
除了我们之外没有人投资了一大笔钱在业余软件上。

I was an operating system developer.

使用它，组建一个新的社团”

to keep using computers without

way out of that moral dilemma

what I had to do with my life.
并且我意识到这将成为我毕生要做的事情。

228
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,700
I actually began the project in January of 1984.
这个项目实际上开始于1984年一月。

229

Because it's a recursive acronym.

It stands for "GNU's Not Unix".

234
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,300
You see so the "G" in "GNU" stands for "GNU".

235
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,400
And what the name means is

the Unix operating system,

240

We were forbidden to share Unix,

我们无法使用Unix。它对这个社区来说
没有使用价值。

243
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,300
So we had to write a replacement for it.
所以我们只能写一个替代品。

244
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,100
Throughout the 1980s,

as Richard Stallman was building the GNU project,

它基于Unix内核，从AT&T获取的授权。

and fragmentation of the source code,

以及破碎的源代码，

were slow to adopt it
黑客们以及其他非机构用户比较难以接受。

252
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,300
Well, Unix consisted of a large number of
separate programs

254
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,400
So we just had to replace these programs
one by one.
所以我们只需要把这些程序一个个替换。

255
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,200
So what I started doing was
writing a replacement for one program,
所以我开始干的事情就是为某个程序写替代品。


256
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,100
and then another, and then another,
然后下一个，再下一个

we had replaced practically all of them.
然后，嗯...直到1991年左右，

free software from non-free software.
这些就是自由软件区别于非自由软件的地方。

what was that... ]
[然后，那时什么？那个许可证？那个是什么...]

363
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,200
Well, Copyleft being a general idea,

in order to use it, you have to have specific example.

performing the goals of
a government grant program.
推动政府授权程序的目标。
//fixme:不通

378
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,500
Uh, and the GPL is really unique in that.
嗯，然而他们之中，GPL绝对是唯一的。

379
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,000
It's not just a license.
It's a whole philosophy that,
它不仅仅是一个许可证。它是一种哲学，

380
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,100
I think, motivated the open source definition.
我认为，激发了开放源代码的定义。

381
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,500
I don't hide that a lot of what I do came from Stallman.
我从来不隐瞒，我做的很多事都来自于Stallman。

382
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,900
A crucial step in the growth of GNU/Linux
and the Free Software movement
GNU/Linux成长和自由软件运动的一个关键的步骤，

383
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,600
was the creation of businesses
based upon the software and philosophy.
就是基于这些软件和哲学的商业市场的诞生。

384
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,300
Grown zero for the beginning of
the business face
从零开始的商业应用源于

385
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,500
was the Electronics Research Lab
at Stanford University.
Stanford大学的电子研究实验室。

386
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,100
Known as ERL, the lab was the place for the first GNU
被称作ERL，这个实验室是第一个产生GNU和Linux

387
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,500
and Linux business founder inspiration.
商业应用灵感的地方。

388
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,600
So right here was where ERL was.
右边这里就是ERL以前所在的位置。

389
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,200
That would have been the entrance
over there next to the uh,
那里以前曾是入口，再后面，嗯

390
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,600
electrical engineering McCullough building.
电子工程McCullough大楼。

391
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,500
As you walk in, you come in,
you walk down the hallway, down here.
当你走入，你进入，走过走廊，来到这里。

392
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,600
My office would have been about, about here.
我的办公室曾经在，在这里。

393
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,000
and then right across the hall,
from that was Michael Tiemann's office.
然后，走右边的前往大厅，
从那里开始是Michael Tiemann的办公室。

394
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:11,700
Michael Tiemann took uh.. and
started a company, Cygnus Software
Michael Tiemann，嗯，开办了一个公司，
Cygnus软件公司。

395
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,600
with the idea was to sell consulting
and services around the GNU Free Software
他的想法是为GNU自由软件进行顾问和服务，

396
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,000
and, well Michael's done very well with Cygnus.
并且，Michanel现在在Cygnus干的很棒。

397
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Well uh, I spend a lot of
time working out uh,
好了，我花了点时间想出，嗯，

398
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
how we were going to make money
我们如何去赚钱。

399
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
and in the original GNU manifesto
在原有的GNU宣言中，

400
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
which is the last chapter
of the GNU Emacs manual.
也是GNU Emacs手册的最后一章。

401
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Stallman proposed a number of different
Stallman 提出了几种筹集资金

402
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,800
possible ways to make money.
的方法。

403
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,800
Form the beginning of the
Free Software movement
自由软件运动刚刚起步的时候

404
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,000
I had the idea that there's
我就意识到

405
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
room in it for business to be done.

406
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,700
One of the advantages of Free Software is that, there's
自由软件的优势之一就是它提供一个自由的市场

407
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,000
a free market for any kind of service or support.
里面有各种各样的服务可供选择

408
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
So if you are using software in your business,
所以，如果你在工作中使用某个软件

409
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
and you want good support,
而且你想要得到更好的服务

410
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
you have a choice of people to go to for it,
你就有很多个人可供选择

411
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
you have a choice of businesses... that
你可以在不同的服务中选择

412
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
are in the business of
providing you with support.

413
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So they are going to have to in general give you
所以他们会尽力为你提供好的服务

414
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
good support or you go to somebody else.
否则你可以找其他人

415
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
With proprietory software,
对于那些“版权所有”的软件
416
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,000
support is a monopoly, there is one company,
服务是垄断性质的，一般只有一个公司提供服务
417
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,600
typically, that has the source code
因为只有他们有源码

418
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,500
and only they can give you support
所以也只有他们可以提供服务

419
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,300
so typically, you are at the mercy of a monopoly.
这样你就一直在这种垄断的掌握之下

420
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,600
That's the case, for example with Microsoft.
这方面的典型的就是微软

421
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,900
So no wonder the support is so bad.
这也就难怪他们提供的服务这么差

422
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,500
The benefits of Free Software were
自由软件的优点很多

423
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,200
tremendous but the cost of supporting it internally
但是为它提供服务很难

424
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,800
uh, and made managers very very nervous and
这使软件的管理者很不安

425
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,500
so the fundamental idea I had was
if we can build a model
所以我原先的想法是如果我们可以建立一种

426
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,500
that could deliver two to four times the support
模式，它可以提供2 - 4倍的服务
427
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,000
and uh, and uh, and hand holding capability

428
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,100
that an internal engineer could provide.

429
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,100
And we could do it at 1/2 to 1/4 of the cost

430
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,300
that would meet the test of wether or not

431
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,900
people would actually buy.

432
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,400
And by about the Fall of that year, we had
到了那年秋天，

433
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,300
all the things worked out about who
我们已经拟定出所有的方案

434
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,900
needed on the technical team, what


435
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,800
the terms the sale would be, what

436
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,600
the key price point were, and we


437
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,600
actually received our incorporation in Nov of 1989.
到了1989年11月，我们有了自己的组织。

438
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,800
One of the most difficult things in starting our company
在公司创始之初，最大的困难之一就是
439
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,400
was actually finding a name for it.
给它取个名字

440
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,000
I explained this to one of my friends
我问了我的一个朋友
441
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,400
"we're having difficulty"

442
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,900
and he returned an e-mail message
他回了一封e-mail给我
443
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,800
that basically just had a bunch of words
with the name "GNU" in it.
说公司名字里面应该有"GNU"三个字母

444
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,600
And "Cygnus" was the one that
looked least obnoxious and least obscene.
"Cygnus"是个不错的选择

445
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,600
I can say very clearly that Cygnus
我可以明确的说 Cygnus

446
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,600
was the first business that specialized in Free Software.
是第一个自由软件公司

447
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,100
Cygnus supported Free Software,
Cygnus为自由软件提供服务

448
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:36,100
filled a very essential niche because
we had this great software,
填补了一个重要的空白。因为我们有了伟大的软件，

449
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:40,100
you could get it for nothing but
you couldn't get support - they made their money
你可以不费任何代价得到它，但是你却得不到服务。
450
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,200
by charging for support.
他们通过为自由软件提供服务来赚钱

451
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,900
The GNU project started by building a toolkit,
GNU项目是从建立一系列的工具开始的
452
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,800
a basic development tool such as
a C compiler, a debugger, a text-editor,
基本的开发工具，比如C编译器，调试器，文本编辑器

453
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,500
and uh, other necessary apparatus.
还有一些其他的必备工具。

454
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:59,000
And their intention was eventually to
develop a kernel to sit underneath those
最后的目的就是开发一个内核

455
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,600
and be the center of the operating system.
作为这个操作系统的中心。

456
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,400
By about 1990 they had successfully
developed that toolkit,
到了1990年，他们已经开发出必备的工具软件
457
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,400
and it was in wide use on great many variants of Unix.
这些软件已经在很多Unix系统上得到广泛应用了
458
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,100
But there was still no free kernel.
但是内核仍然是“非自由”的

459
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:16,100
The kernel happened to be
one of the last things we started to do
内核恰巧是我们最好要做的东西

460
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,400
and we had started it not long before.
我们不久前才开始开发我们自己的内核

461
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,400
And that's when Linus Torvalds came along.
就在那个时候，Linus加入进来

462
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,700
[ "Lin-us" or "Line-us"? What's the exact,
do you prefer the pronunciation? ]
[ Linux应该怎么发音？"Lin-us"，“Line-us"?
你个人喜欢哪一种发音？]

463
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,600
um.. When I speak Swedish it's "Lee-nus";
我说瑞典语的时候，是"Lee-nus"

464
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,000
when I speak Finnish it's "Leen-ous";
说芬兰语的时候是”Leen-ous"

465
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,800
when I speak English it's "Line-us".
说英语的时候是"Line-us"

466
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,600
And I really don't care how people pronounce my name.
我本人并不关心人们怎么去读它

467
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,400
But "Linux" is always "Linux".

468
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,800
He developed a kernel, and got it working
faster than we got ours working,
他开发了一个内核，他的进度比我们要快

469
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,900
and got it to work very nicely and solidly.
他的内核运行性能优越，运行稳定

470
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,800
His kernel is called "Linux".
他把他的内核叫做"Linux"

471
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,500
The initial goal was my very personal goal
开发Linux的最初目的是很个人化的
472
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,100
to be able to run a similar environment on my computer
我在大学学习的时候，我习惯了那里的操作系统，所以我想
473
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,300
that I had grown used to at, at the university computers.
在我自己的计算机上装一个类似的系统

474
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:05,300
And I could not find anything that suited me for that.
我当时没有找到符合要求的现成系统

475
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,400
So having been doing computers for all my life basically.
因为我今后一直要跟计算机打交道，
476
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,500
At that point I decided that I'll do my own.
所以我决定自己开发一个这样的系统出来

477
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Most of the inspiration early on came from, from SunOS
在开发之初，很多灵感都来自于SunOS

478
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,900
which was what um,
I was using at the university at the time.
我在大学的时候就用的这个系统

479
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,000
[ Which University? ]
[ 哪所大学？ ]

480
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,700
University of Helsinki in Finland.
芬兰赫尔新基大学

481
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,100
From 1991 to about 1993 was really
我认为从1991到1993

482
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,700
I guess the infancy period of Linux.
是Linux发展的幼儿时期

483
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,400
That was when it was still only alpha or beta quality;
那个时候Linux是处于开发与测试阶段

484
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,800
it was relatively unstable.
并且相对来说很不稳定

485
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,600
Although, even then it was a good deal more stable
不过那个时候的Linux比现在很多所谓的

486
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,600
than a lot of what are now called
"production" operating systems.
”成品“操作系统要稳定的多。

487
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,600
Linus used the traditional
tried-and-true method of writing one program
Linus使用传统的"tried-and-true"方式来写程序

488
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,500
that does the job,

489
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,800
and he got it to work.
并且工作的很好

490
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,500
quickly in fact faster than
I would have thought was possible.
比我自己预计的要快的多

491
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,500
The term for it is "monolithic",
Linux是单一内核的操作系统

492
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:09,400
which means that basically
the OS itself is one entity, indivisible.
也就是说操作系统本身是一个不可分的整体

493
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,400
uh, while in the microkernel,
它不像微内核系统那样，

494
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,900
the, the operating system kernel is actually
微内核系统实际上是一组服务，

495
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,700
uh, just a collection of servers that
它们做不同的工作，

496
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,500
do different things and then they have a common protocol
彼此通过一个共同的协议来通讯，

497
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,700
for doing communication between themselves.
来协调它们的动作.

498
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:31,800
[ So why is that... the GNU project that's had
so much lead-time, that's been doing this,
[ 为什么GNU的内核开发的这么慢？

499
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,100
Why...Why is it that he was able to kinda
come in at the tail end so to speak ]
为什么

500
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:40,800
Well we actually started the
GNU Hurd not long before he started Linux.

501
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,700
And it happened though we chose a design
that's a very advanced design

502
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,300
in terms of the power gives you

503
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,900
but also turns out to be very hard to debug.

504
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:57,300
We decided to divide up the kernel
which traditionally had been one program,

505
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,600
to divide it up into a lot of smaller programs

506
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,600
that would send messages to
each other asynchronously to, to communicate.

507
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,500
The problem is that, that style of programming

508
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,800
has a great deal of potential for bugs,

509
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,700
which are often very hard to
figure out because they depend on...

510
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:22,100
does this program send this message
before or after this one sends that message...

511
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:27,300
And the result was:
it took us years to get the thing to work.

512
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,700
[ What is Linux's relationship to the GNU project? ]

513
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:39,100
Well there's relationships to GNU
on kind of multiple levels.

514
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,600
One is just the philosophical level of thinking that

515
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,700
"making your source open is a good idea".

516
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:51,300
When Linus developed the kernel
he wasn't doing it for the GNU project.

517
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,800
He did it independently.

518
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,200
And he released it independently
and we didn't know about it.

519
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,500
But some of the people who did know about it

520
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,000
decided to look for what else they could find

521
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,300
to put together with that kernel to
make a whole system.

522
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:08,300
They looked around, and lo and behold
everything they needed was already available.

523
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,500
They looked around, and lo and behold
everything they needed was already available.

524
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,600
"What good fortune!" they thought.

525
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,900
But actually there was no chance about it.

526
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,900
They had found all the pieces of the
GNU system which was missing just the kernel,

527
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,600
so when they put all that together

528
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,600
really they were fitting
Linux into the gap in the GNU system.

529
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,400
But they didn't know that.

530
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,800
There's a lot of these programs

531
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,600
um, done by the Free Softwares Foundation,

532
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,800
and done by other people like Linux.

533
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,800
And there's a symbiosis between
Linux and the programs

534
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,700
that the programs run on Linux and at the same time

535
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,100
and they take the advantage of Linux as a platform,

536
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,700
while Linux takes the advantage of the programs

537
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,700
by just being able to use them.

538
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,300
[ What...What programs? ]

539
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,100
umm...

540
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,100
The main one is actually the GNU C Compiler.

541
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,300
Which... Without a C compiler
it would not have been possible

542
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:09,500
to make Linux or most of the open progress available.

543
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,700
Linux uses the GPL,

544
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:17,400
and I agree with a kind of philosophy behind the GPL.

545
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:23,200
That said the GPL itself is not a very pretty document

546
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,800
which is probably just because
no lawyerese can ever be very pretty.

547
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,800
I'd been playing around with Linux for actually

548
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,300
late '92 or early '93 for about a year.

549
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:45,900
before I decided that it was to the point
where actually had everything that I needed

550
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,300
to really replace a Sun Workstation.

551
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:52,300
And I was looking for a way to
have a Unix workstation at home

552
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,400
at the time we used Sun Sparc Stations
in the office at Stanford.

553
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,400
Those machines cost us about 7,000 dollars.

554
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,900
Now I desperately wanted a Unix machine at home!

555
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,600
There's always a this thought
you get as you get a graduate student

556
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,900
"Gee... if I could work at home!

557
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,800
Then I would be so much more productive,

558
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,900
I would graduate sooner because
I would finish my thesis sooner"

559
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,000
Well, Well, is it true? Well, you can judge.

560
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,800
You know most people end up spending a lot of their time

561
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,300
becoming more productive so that

562
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:24,500
they ever actually worked on their thesis
they'll finish it in a day.

563
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,200
It takes a while sometimes.

564
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,500
So I decided that I wanted a Unix machine at home.

565
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,500
And I went out there I was able to
use Linux together with the PC.

566
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,500
For about 2,000 dollars, I put together a system.

567
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,400
That was one and a half to two times faster

568
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,100
than that 7,000 dollars Sun Sparc Station.

569
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,800
It was absolutely amazing.

570
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,800
I had one and a half to two times the speed,

571
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,500
at a third to fourth the price.

572
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,800
Light bulbs went off.

573
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,000
I knew there was an opportunity here.

574
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
This was the chance to really do something
better than what Sun has done

575
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,700
around open source and Linux.

576
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,300
I called it Linux originally as working name.

577
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,800
And that was just because Linus

578
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,000
and the it has to be there.

579
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,100
It's Unix. It's like a law.

580
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,000
And...what happened was that...

581
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,800
I initially thought that I can't call it Linux publicly,

582
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,100
because it is just too egotistical.

583
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,400
And that was before I had a big ego. Right?

584
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,700
They thought they were taking a whole bunch
of components putting them around Linux

585
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,400
So they ended up calling the whole thing
"A Linux System"

586
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,100
and somehow that term caught on.

587
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,600
And the result is

588
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,600
there are now ten million people using

589
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,100
this variant of the GNU system...

590
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,400
the GNU/Linux operating system.

591
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,500
And most of them don't know it.

592
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,800
[ Some people advocate it be described as GNU/Linux.

593
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,300
I mean what's your thought on
that? I would say, justify or... ]

594
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:57,600
Well, I think it's justified but it is justified
if you actually make GNU distribution of Linux.

595
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:05,100
The same way that I think that Red Hat Linux
is fine or SuSE Linux, or Debian Linux.

596
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Uh, because if you actually make your
own distribution of Linux

597
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,800
You get to name the thing.

598
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,900
But calling Linux in general "GNU Linux"
I think, is just ridiculous.

599
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,600
I got involved in Fall '93.

600
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:25,100
Because I was sent a copy of the first CD-ROM
commercial Linux distribution,
因为我拿到了一份第一份商业发行的Linux光盘拷贝

601
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,500
which was called Yggdrasi produced by Adam Richter.
称之为Yggdrasi,由Adam Richter制作

602
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,600

我拿到这份拷贝是因为...

603

606
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,300
I was completely astonished.
我完全被震惊了

about controlling complexity,
keeping a project group small,

610
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,700
having closely managed objectives.

我坚决的想指出他们只怎么做到的

that made it a must-have technology

with the development of a program
that made complex websites possible
开发了一个使建设复杂网站变成可能程序

the Apache web server.

exactly track each other.

web server project really got started,

was also the beginnings of the popular ISP explosion
正好也是流行的ISP爆发的开始

when the Internet first became a mass market commodity

I think it was one of the first applications
that caused people to go
我想那是人们去做的第一个理由

630
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,000
"Well, if I install Linux."

interesting applications on Linux

the knowledge wasn't very expensive
这种知识并不很贵

649

00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,800
at no charge or at little charge.
不要付钱或者一点点钱

775
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,000
Now the real problem was that they feared
现在现实的问题是他们害怕

776
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,500
Microsoft would achieve a monopoly lock on the browser market
Microsoft会到达一个浏览器市场垄断的地位

777
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:10,300
and they would then use that monopoly lock to
然后他们会用那种垄断的地位

778
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,900
pervert actually,
随意修改

779
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:15,900
the HTTP and HTML standards that the web depends on.
那些网站依赖的HTTP和HTML标准。

780
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,900
And once they had turned those
standards in to lock in devices,
他们一旦使了这些协议成为了他们垄断的策略

781
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:23,900
they could then use that control
to drive Netscape out of the server market,
他们就可以用那些协议把Netscape驱赶出服务器市场，

782
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,600
which was where it was making its real money.
那个才是真正赚钱的地方

783
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,500
My concern was that as time went on,
我关心的是随着时间继续，

784
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,300
Netscape's business would be threatened,
Netscape的业务会受到威胁，

785
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:37,100
by the fact that we didn't have enough people
to do what we needed to do as a company
事实上是我们没有足够的人做一个公司需要做的事

786
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:41,000
in order to keep our software viable in the marketplace.
去保持我们软件的市场地位

787
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:45,300
The Netscape release happened in early 1998.
Netscape早在1998年就发布了

788
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:49,300
And uh, I was told later, I had no idea at the time,
然后uh，我后来才被告知的，我当时完全不知道

789
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,600
that it came about as a direct result of
直接导致的结果是

790
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,400
the right people having read
"The Cathedral and the Bazaar".
一个恰当的人读了"大教堂和杂货店"

791
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,600
"The Cathedral and the Bazaar",
the paper by Eric Raymond,
"大教堂和杂货店"Eric Raymond写的论文

792
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:05,200
was a significant influence on
Netscape's decision to release source code.
对Netscape决定发布源代码有着及其重大的影响

793
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,100
It came as a complete shock to me.
那对我来说是一个巨大的震惊

794
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,300
I wasn't really ready for the thought
我根本没有准备好

795
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,500
that I was changing the world even by accident.
我因为一个意外改变了整个世界

796
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,200
However he was not by any means
the only influence on that decision.
无论怎样，从任何意义上来说他不是这个决定的唯一影响。

797
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,700
Uh, and not necessarily the most important one,
uh，而且不是必要的最重要的一个

798
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,400
when all is said and done.
当一切已经公布于众以后

799
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,600
As I said, Netscape,
就像我说的，Netscape，

800
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,600
Netscape had already been talking about
releasing source code for quite some time before
Netscape曾有好几次提起过要开放源代码

801
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,200
anyone ever heard of Eric's paper.
曾有人从Eric的文章中看到这消息的。

802
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,600
Linux Congress in early 1997,
1997初的Linux大会

803
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,600
which was the first place that I gave that paper.
也就是我第一次发出这个消息的地方

804
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:39,900
And one of the people who heard it was
Tim O'Reilly of O'Reilly and Associates.
其中一个人听说这是Tim O'Reilly和他的同事
//fixme:unknow meanings

805
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,300
And uh, he thought it was pretty intriguing
并且，嗯，他认为这很吸引人。

806
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:47,300
and he asked me to give it at
his first PERL conference, which was uh..
于是他邀请我在他的第一个Perl会议上给他，

807
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,900
later that year, in Fall of 97.
嗯，也就是那年的后半年，97年秋。

808
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,500
And apparently what happened, I was told later,
然而似乎发生了什么事情，我被告知会议推迟了，

809
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,000
although I had no idea that this was happening at the time,
尽管我对当时发生了什么事毫不知情，

810
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:01,500
uh is that some people from Netscape actually
heard the paper at the PERL conference
嗯，而事实上是一些Netscape的人从Perl会议听说了这个消息。

811
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:05,500
and took those ideas back to Netscape and
they kind of lit a fire there.
然后把这些主意带回Netscape，并且引起了很大的争论。
//fixme:unsure

812
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,600
The role of my paper was essentially
to make the internal case at Netscape, uh
我的文章的中心本质上是,让Netscape以内部举措,嗯
//fixme:unsure

813
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:13,700
to make the business case for
why Netscape should release its source code.
是商业举措，来开放他的源代码。
//fixme:unsure

814
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:17,500
The paper was called
"Netscape Source Code As Netscape Product".
这篇文章叫做“作为Netscape产品的源代码”

815
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:22,200
uh.. a strange title,
essentially what the title meant was that
嗯，一个奇怪的标题，实际上标题的意思是

816
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,000
In my opinion we needed to
我的意思是我们需要

817
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:27,900
think of source code not just as something
that was used in creating our products,
把源代码不仅仅考虑成用于创早我们产品的东西，

818
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,100
but as something that was a product in its own right.
而是源代码本身就是一个产品

819
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,200
Something that customers might use, other people might use.
用户也许会使用，其他人也可能使用。

820
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,500
I then looked at what the business models might be
然后我看到了一个可能的商业模型

821
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,400
if we released source code for our products.
如果我们开放我们代码，作为产品。

822
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,100
How would we license them?
我们用什么许可证呢？

823
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:45,100
How do we sell products in this environment?
在这种环境下如何卖产品？

824
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,600
Then I looked at the competition, particularly Microsoft.
然后我们看了一下竞争对手，尤其是微软。

825
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,200
What would they be likely to do
if we released source code?
如果我们开放代码，他们可能做的事情是什么？

826
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,800
Was there some way they could
use our source code against us?
他们有什么办法利用我们的代码与我们竞争？

827
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,800
I used Eric's paper as an example of
how distributed development could work,
我用Eric的文章作为例子，证明分布式的开放是有效的，

828
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:03,400
how a company could develop software not
just using their own people,
一个公司如何开放产品？并不仅仅依赖他自身的员工，

829
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,200
but also working with people on the Internet.
还依赖Internet上面的人们。

830
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,900
And that's why I included a reference to
Eric's paper in my paper.
这就是我为什么在我的文章中引用了Eric的文章。


831
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,700
Once my paper was circulated,
一旦我的文章传播出去，

832
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,100
the people who read my paper would naturally enough
读过的人们很自然会通过这个引用，

833
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:18,100
find a reference to Eric's paper
and read that as well.
来寻找Eric的文章，并一起阅读。

834
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,700
[ And who was involved in
making that happen at Netscape? ]
[ Netscape公司里还有谁和此事有关？]

835
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:25,100
Primarily the person who made the
actual decision was Jim Barksdale.
最主要的做出决定的人是Jim Barksdale。

836
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:28,000
And this turned out to be important later.
然而后来这变得非常重要
//fixme:unsure

837
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,800
That our big win, the big score
那是我们的伟大胜利，伟大的成功

838
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,400
that gave us mainstream
visibility and credibility with investors
使大部分投资者对我们的极为关注并充满信心

839
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,400
came not because of bottom up evangelism
from a bunch of engineers,
这些并不是来自一群工程师不务正业的传道工作
//fixme:just my guess

840
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:41,600
but because one strategist at the top
而是来自于最伟大的战略

841
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,900
saw the potential power of this method and
看到了这种方法的潜力，

842
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:46,800
then essentially imposed that vision
on everyone underneath him.
然后实际上强迫每个人目光注视着他。
//fixme:unsure

843
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:51,100
When I completed the paper,
I first gave a copy to Mark Andreessen,
当我完成这篇文章，我先给
Mark Andreessen一份，

844
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:55,100
who was co-founder of Netscape and
was at the time one of,
他曾是Netscapoe的合作创始者，

845
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,900
on the senior management team at Netscape.
并且他是Netscape的高层之一。

846
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:00,900
Mark then gave a copy of the paper to several
other people within Netscape management,
Mark然后把这篇文章传递给Netscapeg管理层的其他人。

847
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,100
including Jim Barksdale.
包括Jim Barksdale。

848
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,200
I'm not sure exactly when Jim and
the other senior managers
我不十分肯定是什么时候，Jim和其他高级经理

849
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,300
made the actual decision,
做出了这个决定，

850
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,300
I believe it was in early January sometime.
我觉得应该是一月上旬的某天。

851
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,900
Netscape actually announced that it was gonna
release the source code on Jan 22nd,
Netscape真正宣布他将开放源代码的日子是一月22日。

852
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,900
the same time it was going to give
Communicator away for free.
同时，也将让Communicator(著名浏览器)免费发行。

853
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,000
When Netscape decided to release the source code,
当Netscape决定开放代码时，

854
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,400
people sort of got a wake up notice and said
人们注意到这一点，并且说
//fixme:howtotran?

855
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,900
"Hey, maybe there is something to this idea
of releasing source code
“嘿，也许这主意的确不赖，开放源代码

856
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:32,400
and doing development with people
outside your company."
并于公司之外的人们共同开发”

857
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:38,200
So Netscape's decision brought a lot of
public attention to the idea of Free Software,
所以Netscape的决定引起了公众对自由软件的注意，

858
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,500
what became known as Open Source,
也就是现在所谓的开放软件，

859
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,000
and brought a lot of attention to
the Linux operating system,
并且引来了对Linux操作系统的许多注意力。

860
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
which was one of the most prominent examples of
Open Source software at that time.
Linux是当时开放软件中最为突出的例子。

861
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,800
This is our first office, Mountain View, California.
这就是我们第一个办公室，Mountain View, California。

862
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,200
We moved here in early 1995.
我们在1995年初搬到这儿。

863
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,100
This is 4,000 square feet.
这里有4000平方英尺。

864
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:06,700
It was an incredible leap of faith for us to
move out and take the company to our own office.
对我们来说，搬出去，开个自己的公司，拥有自己的
办公室，这对我们的信仰是个难以想像的跳跃。

865
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,700
Now what's really important about this place
现在，关于这个地方最重要的是

866
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:13,300
is that this is the office
where the term "Open Source" was invented.
这是一个由“开放源码”的团队所创造的办公室。

867
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:18,000
If you walk in to an executive's office
and say "Free Software",
如果你走入一个执行官的办公室，然后说“自由软件”

868
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:22,100
OK, If you're lucky, the response
you'll get is something like,
很好，如果你很幸运，得到的回答会像：

869
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:28,600
"hmm, hmm, Free Software, must be
cheap, shoddy, worthless."
“嗯，嗯，自由软件，一定是便宜、质量低劣、不足取的。”

870
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,600
Uh, and if you're not lucky,
it has associations with, uh.
嗯，如果你不是很走运，那么你会听到类似于，嗯

871
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
with the Free Software Foundation's
wholesale attack on intellectual property rights,
自由软件基金行为的严重侵犯了智力财产的权力，

872
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,000
which regardless of what
you think about the ethics of that,
这种行为不顾道德论理，

873
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
it's lousy marketing, it's not something
that businesses want to hear.
这是无耻的交易，它不为正规商业所认同。

874
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,900
So Eric Raymond knew there was a problem.
所以Eric Raymond知道这是一个问题。

875
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,100
We'd been calling this Free Software,
我们把这个称为自由软件，

876
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:54,100
but people took the term "Free"
and associated with "Free of charge",
但是人们把这个自由的字眼和“免费”联系在一起，

877
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,200
they thought they couldn't make money or couldn't sell,
他们认为他们无法从中获利或根本买不出去，

878
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,100
which is exactly the wrong concept.
这是完全错误的想法。

879
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:04,700
We wanted to get across the idea the software
was open and that the source code was available.
我们需要讲清楚这个意思是，软件是开放的，
源代码是可以获取的。

880
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:07,000
Very important pieces.
非常重要的一点。

881
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,700
We had this meeting at the VA offices
in Mountain View, where Eric,
我们在VA的办公室里面开了这个会议，当时Eric，

882
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:17,200
myself, and Christine Peterson from Foresight Institute
joined us as well as some other people.
我，以及来自Forsight Institute的Christine Peterson
和其他的人一样加入了我们。

883
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,100
Christine Peterson was there by phone. uh..
Christine Peterson当时在那儿打电话，嗯。

884
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,600
Jon "Mad dog" Hall was also there by phone. uh..
"疯狗"Jon Hall也在那里打电话，嗯。

885
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,300
And then Todd Anderson, who later worked for
SuSE for a while was there.
然后Todd Anderson，那个后来为SuSE工作的
那个人也在那里。

886
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:33,300
Sam Ockman who now runs Penguin Computing was there.
Sam Ockman，现在开设了Penguin Computing，当时也在那里。

887
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:36,700
He was uh.. He was an employee of VA at the time
他，嗯，他当时是VA的雇员，

888
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,600
Well, we came up with the concept of Open Source,
然后，我们一起统一了开放源码的概念，

889
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,900
we called Linus in fact and asked Linus if he liked it.
我们打电话给Linus,并询问他是否喜欢这个词。

890
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,100
He was interested, He liked it.
他很感兴趣，他喜欢。

891
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,600
Eventually we came up with something that replaced "Free Software".
然后我们搞出了一个东西，用来取代“开放/免费软件”。

892
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,200
That was the beginning of Open Source.
这就是开放源码的起源。

893
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,300
[ How did you chose words "Open Source"? ]
[你们为什么选中“开放源码”这个词？]

894
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:57,100
You know, I think Christine Peterson was
the person who really came up with the idea.
你要知道，我认为Christine Peterson
是想出这个主意的人。

895
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:04,300
Uh, we wanted, again, the idea
that the source code was out there and it was open.
嗯，他想要一个，一样的，开放的源代码。

896
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,700
There weren't many choices.
这并没有很多选择。

897
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:11,800
Well, since the first three recipients have
spoken for the Open Source movement,
然而，既然前三位接收了开放源码运动的说法，

898
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,300
I think I should speak about
the Free Software movement.
我认为我应该说说自由软件运动。

899
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:19,800
The Open Source movement,
focuses on practical advantages
开放源码运动集中于非常实际的利益

900
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,500
that you can get by having a community of users
你可以从社团成员中获得这些利益

901
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:26,500
who can cooperate on interchanging and improving software.
这些成员进行合作，替换和改善软件。

902
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:30,400
I agree completely with the points they make about that.
我完全同意这一点，即他们能够产生这些利益。

903
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,900
The reason why my views are different,
while I am in the Free Software movement
我对于自由软件运动的观点为什么不同的原因，

904
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,000
rather than the Open Source movement,
而不是开放源码运动，

905
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
is that I believe there's something
more important at stake.
是我相信这些不同之间，有些更重要得东西。
//fixme:unknow meanings.

906
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,000
That freedom to cooperate with other people,
freedom to have a community...
那就是与其他人合作的自由，拥有一个社团的自由...

907
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,200
is important for our quality of life.
这些对提高我们生活质量很重要。

908
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:51,200
It's important for having a good society
that we can live in.
能够生活在一个好的社区对我们来说很重要。
//fixme:improve it.

909
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:57,300
And that that is in my view, even more important
than having powerful and reliable software.
这就是我的观点，这比拥有强大的和可靠的软件重要的多。

910
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:01,800
But I think some of the people in
the Free Software camp...
但是我觉得一些自由软件阵营的人...

911
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:06,000
are a little scared by the commercialization.
对商业化有点畏惧。

912
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
And uh, you know,
of course a rebel is put off by success.
并且，嗯，你知道的，成功能够推迟反叛。
//fixme:unsure.

913
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:15,900
uh.. I think that commercialization is very important.
嗯，我认为商业化非常重要。

914
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,700
We want to mainstream this software,
我们需要这个软件成为主流，

915
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:23,900
and I work with Richard Stallman
who's the gray haired man of Free Software,
并且我与Richard Stallman一起工作，
他是个灰发男人，自由软件成员之一，

916
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:28,400
uh, on a regular basis, and I don't feel
嗯，在某些基本立场上，我不觉的

917
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,900
I have any philosophical differences.
我有任何哲学上的不同。

918
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:35,000
me as author the Open Source definition and
我作为给出开放源码定义的人，和

919
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:40,300
he is originator of free software as an organized thing,
他作为自由软件的创始人，

920
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,800
except for one thing.
Richard thinks that all software should be free,
除了一点，Richard觉得所有的软件应该是开放的，

921
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,500
and I think that free software and
non-free software should coexist.
而我觉得开放软件和非开放软件应该共同存在。

922
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,200
That's the only difference we have.
这就是我们仅有的区别。

923
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,800
Uh, we decided early on that what we needed,
嗯，我们起先决定所需要的东西，

924
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,800
a..a definition, we needed a kind of
meta-license to define the term "Open Source".
嗯..一个定义，我们需要一种类似于上层许可证
来定义“开放源码”这个字眼

a, a definition, we needed a kind of
meta-license to define the term "Open Source".

来定义“开放源码”这个字眼

And what we came up with is a document called
"The Open Source Definition".
然而我们共同确定的是一个叫做
“开放源码定义”的文档。

927
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:08,800
It's derived from the Debian Free Software guidelines
that were originally written by Bruce Parens.
它来源于Debian自由软件准则，最初由Bruce Parens所写。

928
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:12,600

discussed it for a month with the Debian developers

was really pivotal

01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:02,500
and if they told us they get lost, we'd say,
"Fine, we are going to Foster city. Bye."
如果他们说他们迷路了， 我们会说？“好， 我们要去Foster”？

1149
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:06,000
It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of
avoiding the cops, so...
？？这是避免警察干涉的方法

1150
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:11,000
Well actually, originally we marched
on the other side of this building.
当时， 一开始我们是从这座房子的另一边开始游行的

1151
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,000
We marched around and up onto the parking
structure that's up there,
我们四周游行并且上到了那边？？

1152
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,900
and that's where Microsoft had a reception
laid out for us with
？那是微软为我们准备的接待会的地方？

"Microsoft Welcomes the Open Source Community".
“微软欢迎开源社团”

1155
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:26,400
and the local news cameras got shots of
Eric Raymond and Microsoft representative.
本地的新闻镜头摄下了Eric Raymond 和微软代表

1156
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:30,400
Microsoft's story seems to mostly be that...
微软的解释就是这样....

1157
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:35,000
...this was not an issue for Microsoft,
rather from the OEMs.
....这不是微软的过失， 主要是OEM 厂商的问题

1158
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,300
So we all needed to go back to our
computer manufacturers and try yet again
因此我们还是需要回到我们的计算机制造商那里 再试一次

to try and get refund from them.

1161
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:46,100
that we tried that and it's not possible,
we need Microsoft to take action at this point.
我们试过了但是不可能，我们需要微软出面来解决问题

1162
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,000
And they just repeated the tag line
over and over again...
他们只是重复？标记？的行，一遍又一遍

1163
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,000
"you need to go to the OEMs and manufacturers
and get your refunds there."
“你需要到OEM 和厂商那里得到你的退款”

1164
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:58,000
We had about 150 people,
probably half of voyage had signs and such, so..
我们有大概有150 人？大约一半手中有标语什么的 因此....？
1165
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:02,000
Well, we ended up actually right
in this courtyard here.
我们在这个？广场? 上止步

1166
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:06,000
Basically we originally met, gathered outside,
？开始我们？

1167

various people sent groups in,
people from FreeBSD camp sent a couple of folks in.
很多人组织小组参加
FreeBSD 社团派了一些人过来

1168
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,000
We had Eric Raymond and Christ
actually tried to go up eventually.
最后Eric Raymond 和Christ 进去了

1169
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:17,600
They had blocked the elevator off to us.
他们封锁了电梯

1170

[ Where are the offices? ]

The offices are right up here on the 9th floor.
办公室在上面9层

1172
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,100
We got some really nice parts out of it.
？？

1173
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:26,500
and we think as a result
？？

1174
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:30,500
Toshiba made a possible for you to buy
laptop without the operating system on it.
Toshiba 提供了买没有操作系统的电脑的可能

1175
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,000

Well, even now, companies such as IBM and...

Windows on them.
现在买没有安装Windows 的机器

1179
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,800
When I was a kid and I went to school,

the teachers will try to teach us to share.
老师教我们要学会共享

1181
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:58,100
They said if you bring some candy,
老师说如果你有糖

1182
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:01,200
you can't eat it all yourself, you
got to share with other kids.
你不能一个人把它们都吃掉，你应该和别的孩子分着吃

should be teaching kids to say yes to licensing.
但是现在校长说老师应当教孩子们对许可证说“我同意”

sharing means you will be put in jail."
....共享意味着你是剽窃者，共享意味着你将被投入监狱

1186

We need the good will,
这不是社会应当运行的轨迹，我们需要好的愿望

at least when it's not too hard,
至少有帮助别人的愿望，当帮助别人并不是很难的时候

because that's the basis of society,

that's the fundamental resource.

1190

They give us a society instead of
a dog-eat-dog jungle.

Well, they were on both counts. For one thing,
哦， ？？， 首先

1195
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,000
people are making a profit from
developing Free Software,
人们利用开发自由软件来获利

1196
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,800
but for another, the freedom to
have a community is more important.
另外， 拥有一个社团的自由是更重要的

1197
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,800
[ People that look at, casually at
Open Source Free Software and think...

share and do it for people's good will,
因为你追求共享， 是为了人的理想而做这件事

What's your response? ]
这样看来不是有点共产主义吗？你怎么回应他们？ ］

1200
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:03,200
Absolutely nonsense,
it makes me really angry when people do that.
完全没有意义，人们这样做只会让我生气
  
1200
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:03,200
Absolutely nonsense,
it makes me really angry when people do that.
一派胡言。人们这么说使我愤怒！
1201
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:08,000
Well, back in, back in 1989,
actually communism would have been a compliment.
好，在1989年的时候，实际上“共产主义”可能还算个恭维
1202
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:10,600
the word people were using at that time
was "crazy",
那时候人们用的词是“疯狂”

and I want them to use capitalism.

如果你不共享，你就会被投入监狱或者被杀掉
1206

but in an event, he came by,

1209

that he visit Cygnus,
Richard Stallman说过他访问过Cygnus
1210
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,000
because he was interested in and
understanding how the Free Software model...
因为他对自由软件的模型感兴趣
1211
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:46,100
might apply to stimulating entrepreneurial
innovation in Russia of all places,
并想把它运用到刺激俄国和其他各地的企业创新中去
1212
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:50,300
and we had been kind of secretive
about our business plan,
我们对我们的商业计划有些保密
1213
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:53,200
because you know, we were not really
sure it's gonna work,
因为你知道，我们并没有把握它一定能行
1214
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,000
we didn't want to look too stupid if it failed.
我们并不想因为它失败而显得很愚蠢
1215
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,300
But I was very very open with him.
可是我对他还是很开诚布公的
1216
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:02,200
The more I told him,
the more he started to shake his head like this,
我对他讲得越多，他越是摇头，就像这样
1217
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:06,000
and I finally said, you know, "What's wrong?"
没有办法，我最后说，“哪里有问题”

01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:11,000
And he said, "This sounds to much like communism
to be successful in Russia."
他说：“这听起来太像要在俄国实现共产主义了。”
1219
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,000

with a bullet in the back of your head.

something it is maintained for our common good.
公路是为我们的公共利益而保有的
1227

Actually labeling our business model...
实际上，为我们的商业模型贴标签
1228
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:53,700
means that it misses the point a little bit.

1229
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:54,800
whether it's communist, or whether it's capitalist,
不过这种标签是共产主义，还是资本主义
1230
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:58,400
the label doesn't matter, the real question is,

how much value can you deliver,
how scalable is the business,
你能传播多少价值，你的生意有多少斤两

it's really up to you.

可能现在你们也觉得它们烦了，因为你们已经听过有十遍了
1267
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,700
But after the technical updates,
we will actually try...
但是在技术升级之后，我们实际上努力想
1268
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:17,200
...whether we can do a question and
answer session with 5,000 people,
我们是否能做一个5000人容量的提问/解答会话系统

or how many of you there are there.
或者不管多少人都行
1270

and it may not actually work out,
不过它不一定真的能做出来
1271
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:26,900
because one of the 5,000 people is really loud.
因为5000人里面有一个声音就已经够大的了

The one thing I will do,

I want to kind of acknowledge the fact that...

...I'm obviously not been alone in doing Linux.

Ah, here it is.

Uh..I don't have any control over that

1328
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:16,600
unfortunately those things can
only be done with non-free software.
不幸的是那些东西只能用非自由软件来做
1329
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:23,400
We give you the award, and before you say a word,

1333

but nothing to match this

to the Free Software Foundation
向自由软件基金会颁发Linus Torvalds奖
1335
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:45,600
is sort of like giving the
Han Solo award to the rebel fleet.
就像反叛舰队办法Han Solo奖一样滑稽
1336
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:56,000
You see, some of you may not realize how far
that analogy goes.
你看，你们一些人还没意识到这个类比是怎么做的
1337
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:01,300
But actually let me tell you
how this, how we got here.

1338
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:02,800
see what happened this.

15 years ago, if you wanted to use a computer,
15年前，如果你想使用一台电脑
1340
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:09,400
the only way you could do it
was to, was with proprietary software,

1341
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:13,000
software that divides and subjugates the users.
这种软件分化并征服了用户
1342
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,900
And most people just...

1343
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:16,200
A lot of people didn't like it.
许多人不喜欢这样
1344
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,700
But they saw there's no alternative.
但是他们看不到替代物
1345
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:21,500
But some of us were determined
to make an alternative.
我们中的一些人决心做一种替代方案
1346
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:25,500
And we said we're gonna develop
a free operating system,
于是我们说我们要开发一种自由的操作系统
1347
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,400
a free software operating system
一种是自由软件的操作系统
1348
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:33,100
that will give users the chance to have freedom
while they use their computers.
它会使用户使用他们电脑的时候有机会得到自由
1349
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:36,300
Now a lot of people said, "Well, it's a nice idea
有人会说“好啊，这是个好主意
1350
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:38,600
but it's so hard, you'll never get it done,
不过它太难了，你永远也不能完成这件事
1351
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:42,500
so I don't wanna participate,
I don't believe you can ever get it done."
所以我不会参与，我不相信你能把它做完
1352
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:45,300
But luckily not everybody said that.
好在不是每个人都这么说
1353
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:49,200
And clearly, we knew
we would eventually get the kernel done.
很清楚，我们知道最终我们会把内核完成
1354
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:50,500
But as it happens.
不过碰巧的是
1355
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:53,600
somebody else did a better kernel before we did.
有人在我们做以前做了一个更好的内核
1356
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:57,200
Now in the old days, we had an overall strategy
所以那时候，我们的总体战略发生了改变
1357
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:00,800
from calling people's attention
to the importance of freedom
从唤起人们对自由的重要性的关注，转移到
1358
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:04,800
To the freedom they can have, or not have,
when they use a computer.
他们使用电脑时他们能得到的自由，或者他们没有得到的自由
1359
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:07,600
Well what can we do about it?
As far as I can tell,
那么我们能做些什么呢？就我而言
1360
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:13,600
the only workable way of trying to
change this make that strategy work again
使那种战略重新运行唯一可行的方法是
1361
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:19,800
is to, spread the word that the operating system
you're using is actually the GNU system.
传播这样的观念，即你在用的操作系统实际上就是GNU系统
1362
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:22,100
Somewhat modify of cause.
当然与原来的有些改变
1363
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:25,100
And when people know this,
当人们知道这点的时候
1364
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:28,600
they'll take a look at the reasons
we developed this system.
他们就会关心为什么我们要开发这套系统
1365
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:30,500
They'll think about these issues.
他们会考虑这些问题
1366
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:33,300
And some of them will decide they agree.
他们中的一些人就会决定同意我们
1367
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:36,600
So I ask people,
please tell the people this is the GNU system.
所以我跟人说，请告诉人们这是GNU系统
1368
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:40,600
It's the combination of the GNU and Linux
so we can call it GNU/Linux
它是GNU和Linux的结合体，所以我们叫它GNU/Linux
1369
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:49,900

你简直不知道将要发生什么

pretty exciting to see that.

我记得有人叫“小声点”，“我们在打电话”，“我们在工作”

for the employees back at the office,

转到这儿来。Sycamore Networks股价从38美圆攀升到270美圆

This has just beat it. And by the way..
刚刚打破记录。另外。。。

that you're not directly cashing out? ]
但是你不能直接拿到怎么看？
1470
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:18,000
So, if I hadn't made Linux available, I mean,
那么，如果我没有把Linux做出来，我想
1471
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,300
I wouldn't have gotten any money that way either.
我也不会得到任何钱
1472

1473
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:31,000
Uh, just the fact that there are
a lot of commercial companies
呃，事实是，有了许多商业公司
1474
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:37,000
means that there are a lot of Linux people
who used to work on Linux kind of on the side.
这意味这，许多Linux工作者，以前只能业余为Linux工作
1475
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:40,200

doing what they wanted to do.
现在能做他们想做的并得到报酬了

I wanted them to work on Linux anyway.
那使我很有益，因为我希望他们能在Linux上工作

它是一个有颠覆性的、好玩而聪明的行动
1479
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:22,300
to change society for the better, because
I'm only interested in changing it for the better,

but in a clever way.
